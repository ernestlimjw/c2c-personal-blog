        <h2>Hi, I'm Ernest Lim</h2>
        
        <p>
            I'm a healthcare professional turned software developer, passionate about leveraging technology 
            to solve problems in healthcare and beyond.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My journey began in the medical field, where I worked directly with patients and saw firsthand 
            the challenges and inefficiencies in healthcare systems. This experience sparked my interest in 
            how technology could improve patient care and healthcare delivery.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I decided to transition into software development, teaching myself to code and eventually 
            building applications that bridge the gap between healthcare and technology. Today, I work on 
            projects that aim to make healthcare more accessible, efficient, and patient-centered.
        </p>
        
        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        
        <p>
            Through this blog, I share my experiences transitioning from healthcare to tech, insights on 
            healthcare innovation, and practical coding tutorials. My goal is to inspire and guide other 
            healthcare professionals interested in technology, while also building a community of like-minded 
            individuals passionate about healthcare transformation.
        </p>
