        <h2>Hi, I'm Ernest Lim</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a healthcare professional turned software developer, passionate about leveraging technology 
            to solve problems in healthcare and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey began in the medical field, where I worked directly with patients and saw firsthand 
            the challenges and inefficiencies in healthcare systems. This experience sparked my interest in 
            how technology could improve patient care and healthcare delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this blog, I share my experiences transitioning from healthcare to tech, insights on 
            healthcare innovation, and practical coding tutorials.
