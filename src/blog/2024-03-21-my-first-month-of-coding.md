title: My First Month of Learning to Code - A Clinician's Perspective
date: 2024-03-21
---

It's been one month since I decided to take the plunge into programming, and what a journey it's been! As someone who spent years in healthcare, the transition to thinking like a programmer has been both challenging and exciting.

## The Initial Challenges

The first few weeks were overwhelming. Coming from a clinical background where procedures and protocols are well-defined, the open-ended nature of programming was a significant shift. Some challenges included:

- Understanding abstract programming concepts
- Learning the syntax of a new language
- Dealing with error messages
- Managing the frustration of debugging

## What Helped Me Succeed

Several strategies helped me navigate this new territory:

1. **Starting with the Basics**: HTML and CSS provided a gentle introduction to coding
2. **Finding a Community**: Connecting with other clinicians learning to code
3. **Practice Projects**: Building small, healthcare-related applications
4. **Consistent Schedule**: Dedicating 2 hours every evening to learning

## Unexpected Benefits

While learning to code, I discovered some unexpected parallels with healthcare:

- Problem-solving skills transfer well to programming
- Attention to detail is crucial in both fields
- Documentation is as important as in patient care
- The importance of testing and validation

## Looking Forward

As I continue this journey, I'm excited about combining my clinical knowledge with these new technical skills. The potential to improve healthcare through technology keeps me motivated to learn more.
